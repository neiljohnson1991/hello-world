First Program
My name is Neil Johnson. I am a 25 year old man that lives in Salt Lake City, Utah. I am married and have a full time job in the city doing business development for an advertising company. I like to spend my free time playing Xbox, reading non-fiction history, and cyclying. I am interested in coding because it is a hobby I enjoy and want to learn more about.
